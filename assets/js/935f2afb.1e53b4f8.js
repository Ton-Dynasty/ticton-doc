This section provides a comprehensive understanding of its innovative decentralized mechanism. We delve into the architecture and the step-by-step process that underlines the Oracle\'s functionality, offering a detailed view of its unique approach to maintaining accuracy and integrity in decentralized data verification. Let\'s embark on this journey to understand how the Tic Ton Oracle revolutionizes data validation and security.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ticton/benifts":{"id":"ticton/benifts","title":"The benefits of  Tic Ton Oracle","description":"When contrasted with traditional price feed systems, Tic Ton Oracle boasts several key benefits:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ticton/changer":{"id":"ticton/changer","title":"Why is Tic Ton a Game Changer?","description":"Some might view an oracle as merely a conduit for data, a \\"pipeline\\" facilitating the authentication and dissemination of information from various sources onto the blockchain. Yet, Tic Ton\'s approach doesn\'t rely on predefined \\"trustworthy sources\\"; instead, it motivates diverse sources to supply precise data. Evidently, miners are driven to provide accurate prices, receiving Tic Ton tokens as a reward for their valuable contributions.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"ticton/Introduction":{"id":"ticton/Introduction","title":"What is Tic Ton Oracle?","description":"Tic Ton oracle stands as the premier fully decentralized oracle on the TON platform. Diverging from market-standard final prices set by price providers, it employs Game Theory to craft a decentralized network of non-cooperative games. This network ascertains the ultimate price via mechanisms of arbitrage and bidirectional options, incorporating the chain with random data from decentralized price streams.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
