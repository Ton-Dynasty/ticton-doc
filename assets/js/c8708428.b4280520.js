When a validator attempts to arbitrage, they must also provide a price they deem accurate while paying twice the amount of the base asset (TON). For example, if a quote provider named Maxey quotes 1 TON = 20 jUSDT and transfers one TON and 20 jUSDT into Tic Ton Oracle, but a validator named Alan believes 1 TON = 25 jUSDT, Alan must arbitrage Maxey's quote and transfer two TONs and 50 jUSDT to represent 1 TON = 25 jUSDT."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This requirement of providing double the base asset for arbitrage acts as a safeguard against DoS attacks. Hackers aiming to continually alter prices would need to transfer exponentially increasing amounts of the base asset to Tic Ton Oracle, making it challenging and financially unfeasible. Additionally, if the provided price is incorrect, others can arbitrage this erroneous price. This system encourages providers to offer accurate prices, unlike other Oracles that rely on penalizing mechanisms through token staking."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"2-will-normal-quoters-also-have-to-provide-increasingly-high-amounts-of-assets",children:"2.
